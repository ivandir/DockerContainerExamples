**What is the purpose of this?**

Use these folders to determine which example docker compose files suit your deployment needs.

**nginx-proxy-with-letsencrypt**

Can be used to setup a reverse proxy with absolutely free SSL & TLS 1.2 setup via Let's Encrypt. 
It should save you at least the SSL costs. I use it for hosting 2/3/4 different web applications 
within one $5 Linode VPS.

**container-management-via-portainer**

Simplistic container management UI via portainer. It's a cool way to see what state your server 
containers are in, view their logs, restart them etc...
